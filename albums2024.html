						julie is part of the shoegaze revival, bringing some authentic alternative rock and shoegaze with <i>my anti-aircraft friend</i>. Definitely one of the sadder albums on this list, this band drowns out their feelings with heavy guitar chords, catchy melodies, and pounding drum lines. Haunting lyrics and vocal deliveries are provided throughout by Alex Brady, with help at times from Keyan Pourzand. The droning guitars and loud chords help really envelop your ears in the sound they're going for, and it hits exactly how they want it to. This album feels raw in a good way, and if rock is your vibe you should check this album out.

						Clairo once again showing she's the queen of bedroom pop. <i>Charm</i>, her third album, starts off right where she left off with <i>Sling</i>, with a cinematic and retro style. Clairo creates a cozy and relaxing atmosphere for <i>Charm</i>, at times dipping into a more somber mood. The live instruments included in each song really contribute to this chilled atmosphere. It almost feels like we're in a quaint hometown theater with a couple of friends, and we just happened to catch Clairo playing to a small room without a care in the world. Clairo's voice is absolutely beautiful throughout every song, bringing recognizable softness to this album. You can feel the story of falling in love and everything that comes with it. You can follow the narrative with songs like "Second Nature" being an unrequited love song, "Add Up My Love" being about dealing with a breakup, and the closing track, "Pier 4", being about loneliness and how hard it is to find a real connection. Overall, when I'm in the mood for a soft, heartfelt album, <i>Charm</i> is the one.

						Such a beautiful project. I didn't know Quadeca's work before this, but <i>Scrapyard</i> is such an amazing album despite this being a "throwaway project" according to him. This is a rap-focused album, but it feels like each song goes outside the realm of rap in some way, making it such an interesting listen. Each song is packed with emotion, and for most of these songs, it feels like being on the edge between vulnerability and despair. My favorite example of this is "PRETTY PRIVILEGE", where he sings about the disconnect between how others see him and how he sees himself. The lyrics are vulnerable, he delivers them hauntingly, and the instrumental is washed out and disorienting, creating an emotional listen. However, between the hard-hitting emotional songs, songs like "GUESS WHO?" and "I MAKE IT LOOK EFFORTLESS" provide confident and cocky rap that blew me away. This album not only does the simple things well, but the production expands these simpler ideas and songs into experimental experiences when he chooses. Of course, there are still simpler songs that are beautifully put together and minimalist in a good way. Overall, this album is unique and feels like a window into Quadeca's creative mind while still sounding amazing.

						Absolute banger of an album that gave the world what it needed. The production absolutely hits, and Charli gets help from different producers who make it sound amazing. I think a big reason <i>BRAT</i> is so loved is just how authentic it feels. It feels like Charli speaks her truth on everything, and you can tell when you listen through. There are so many moments in this album that sound amazing even as standalone pieces. The piano in "Mean girls", the first verse after the beat drop in "Everything is romantic", and the chorus in "Club classics" are some of my absolute favorite moments in any songs this year. Also, I included "Spring breakers" from the first deluxe in my top 3 because it deserves to be shouted out. I love the electronic elements included, and I love how mainstream it got even with the quirkier parts. I love this album, and when I'm in the mood, <i>BRAT</i> is on repeat.

						<i>Basspunk</i> is a banger of an electronic dance album by the duo of Ike Clateman and Maria Manow, who just started making music together in 2022. Every single song on here is so catchy and danceable. The production does what it needs to and has an appealing unpolished feel. Maria and Ike clearly had a good time making this, and it shows in each song in slightly different ways. From loud shouting vocals to quirky, bouncy sound design, you can feel the energy. Maria's vocals are similarly raw like the production, and it all works together to make some genuine art that feels like a house party. I love this album. It might not be groundbreaking, but it hits exactly how it needs to. If you're feeling dancey, put on this album for a quick 30 minute listen and start hitting some emotes.

						<i>Weight of the world</i> is Syzy's debut album and helps usher in what feels like a new era of dubstep. From the start, Syzy makes it clear that this album is going to be a trip, and you're just along for the ride. It plunges you face-first into what the sound is going to be: vast synths, piercing dubstep elements, and absolutely insane maximalist production that somehow ties this work perfectly together. This album has some absolutely disgusting drops and incorporates noises I didn't know were possible. The synths and melodies throughout feel sparkly and work together well to help balance out the guttural harshness of the dubstep elements. This album is beautiful. You can feel Syzy's emotion in each track, and it even helped spark my love for harder electronic music than I'd listened to before. I'm amazed this album doesn't have more streams, and if you enjoy huge soundscapes or really stimulating music, you need to listen to this.

						Hell yeah. This duo, Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin, is killing it, and <i>Imaginal Disk</i> is what put me onto them. <i>Imaginal Disk</i> is a beautifully crafted indie pop album with insane consistency. Their dreamy nostalgic sound is well done and really sets this album apart. That sound is consistent yet multilayered, with themes of identity, growth, and love, depending on how you interpret it. I particularly love the concept of understanding and coming to terms with your identity, and you can feel this as you listen, especially in "Image". Not only do the lyrics talk about having a "brand new image", but the sound design features glossy textures that occasionally distort to show unrest beneath the surface. This whole album is like going through a storybook with each song as a chapter. The instrumentals paint each scene for you, and the vocals help you follow along. Matthew is insanely talented with what he produces and how it flows together and Mica's vocals sound angelic. My favorite part of this album is the song arrangement, especially how the last track, "The Ballad of Matt & Mica", reprises part of the first track, "She Looked Like Me!" The ending feels like the triumphant conclusion to a story, after the first track feels like anxious trepidation of what's to come. <i>Imaginal Disk</i> showcases absolutely beautiful storytelling, consistently fantastic tracks, and a cohesive sound throughout, which all help make this one of my favorites from this year.

						<i>Chasing Moving Trains</i> is a beautiful, yearning, heartfelt second album from Roy Blair. This art pop, alternative album feels nostalgic at points, yet still pushes the boundaries of genre. <i>Chasing Moving Trains</i> is a perfect title for this album. It feels like you're losing something yet still pushing forward, chasing, learning. It acknowledges the past, what could've been, what you've lost, but also helps you imagine a future and paints a hopeful, beautiful scene that you have to work for. It's a reminder that the train keeps moving, but it's up to you to move along with it. The lyrics paint vivid pictures in every song, and you can feel the vision Roy Blair had while creating this album. His vocals are unique and satisfying, featuring great singing, pitched-up or pitched-down verses, and poetic hard-hitting rap segments sprinkled throughout. This album is an up-and-down journey, going from the laid-back highs of "Hummingbird" to the depressingly hopeless "Rain". It climaxes with the finale of "Garden". "Garden" is a journey of a song that perfectly ties together this work of art. It feels like you finally got onto the train, with blaring violins imitating horns, poetic verses from Roy Blair indicating his journey to prioritizing himself, an optimistic string accompaniment and surrounding vocal tones as he sings hopefully, but longingly towards the future. This might be my favorite song of the whole year, and it ties this album together beautifully. It's all a journey, something we're working toward, and we'll pass by people and feelings along the way, but we'll keep going.

						<i>boy</i> is a boundary-pushing rap and electronic-influenced album that flows together beautifully and is fully produced by Hollis himself. The soundscape that 2hollis creates with his production is magnificent, and each song feels like you're diving into a new landscape, all within the world of boy. From the haunting, yearning feel of "promise" to the Skrillex-inspired wordless "3", this album covers so many bases while remaining cohesive. The production is absolutely top-tier, and Hollis does what he needs to vocally in each track. His singing fits perfectly, and his rapping hits hard. I absolutely love this album, and I think it's a perfect follow-up to his previous album, <i>2</i>, when I wasn't sure where he would go from there. Easily one of my favorites from this year, and I think anyone can find parts they love.

						This album is close to perfect. <i>LL</i> is part of a new era of electroclash featuring mind blowing concepts with stunning, precise production. Noah and Chandler are easily some of the most creative minds putting out art right now. Love or hate their rockstar personas, no one can deny that what they create  is amazing. My top three songs have been switching around since this album's release, as I keep finding unique parts in each song to latch on to. You can hear the perfectionism applied to this album through each synth, sound, and effect they use to make the songs sound how they envisioned. Even if you're not listening carefully, the songs are catchy and have a fun retro feel with modern production. The drum patterns are tight and unique. The synths are always beautiful, with a wide range of sounds that never feel out of place. Noah's vocals are 2000s-esque and really add to their unique sound. The song arrangement is perfect for building energy without losing you. <i>LL</i> has beautiful dips and peaks throughout the music, taking you on a journey that you may like, or you may not. Either way, they don't care. This album is ridiculously good and even if you don't typically listen to this type of music, I recommend giving it a try.
