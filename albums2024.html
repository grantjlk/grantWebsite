          			<p>(?)Post rock revival is heree, with julie helping bringing some authentic controlled rage rock with my anti-aircraft friend. Definitely one of the sadder albums on this list, this band drowns out their feelings with heavy guitar chords, catchy melodies, and pounding drum lines. Haunting lyrics and vocal deliveries are given throughout by (?)Alex Brady, with help at times from (?). The droning guitars and loud chords help really envelop your ears in the sound they're going for, and it hits exactly how they want. This whole album is about (?), and you can feel it through each song, with each song contributing a bit of a different part of that feeling. This album feels raw in a good way, and if rock is your type of vibe you should check this album out.
