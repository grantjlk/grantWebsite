          			<p>Might just be perfect. LL is part of the electronica revival(??), and it has mind blowing concepts for songs with stunning, precise production. Noah and Chandler are easily some of the most creative minds putting out art right now. Love or hate their rockstar personas, no one can deny that their art is amazing. My top 3 songs have been switching around almost the whole album since LL's release as I keep finding unique parts in each song to latch on to. You can hear the perfectionism applied to this album through each synth, sound, and effect that they apply to make the songs sound how they do. Even if you're not listening carefully, the songs are catchy and have a fun retro feel with modern sounds. The drum patterns are tight and unique. The synths are always beautiful, and have a wide range of sounds that never feel out of place. Noah's vocals are catchy, and really add to their unique sound. The arrangement of songs is perfect for the story they tell, and even if you don't delve deeper this album is still a very fun listen. (story of lyrics?) LL has beautiful dips and peaks through the music, and takes you on a journey that you may like, or you may not. Either way they don't care. This album is ridiculously good and even if you don't like this type of music, I recommend to try listening.
